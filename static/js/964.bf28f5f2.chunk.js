I am an undergraduate student studying computer science in Singapore and I enjoy developing fullstack applications. My favorite languages to code in are OCaml, C++ and Python. Lately, I have also been getting into developing applications in VueJS and Kotlin. \n\nI am also very interested in finance and the financial markets. I used to work at Kredens Capital Management and Singular Asset Management where I recommended trading ideas to my portfolio manager and the Chief Investment Officer. I also had the chance to interact with our brokers and speak with clients. I learned a lot from my employers there.  \n\nFor extracurriculars, I am very invested leading the equity research division in Dragonfly, a Hong Kong based student finance club. There, I teach members basic accounting and stock analysis. Our members come from everywhere, including HKU, CUHK, LSE, U Penn and Cornell. If you would like to join our group, please feel free to send me an email! \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching comedy and playing Dota2. Two books that I believe everybody should read are [A Cofession by Leon Tolstoy][AConfession] and [Man\'s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl][ViktorFrankl]. Some of my favorite shows are Family Guy and One Piece. I also have about 7000+ hours of gameplay playing Dota2.\n[AConfession]: https://www.amazon.com/Confession-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/1548397539\n[ViktorFrankl]: https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X \n# Currently\n\nAt university, I mostly take math and computer science classes. However, I have also taught myself some accounting and economics using free books online. \n# Sports\n\n- I have been swimming since I was 3 years old. \n- I enjoy hiking and camping.\n- I have recently gotten into archery thanks to my colleagues from Investree.\n\n# Fun Facts\n\n- I was born in Indonesia.\n- I have been living independently since I was 16 years old. \n- My motto: "Be good, work hard and great things will happen."\n',d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(t.rU,(0,o.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(r.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Alan Matthew",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(t.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(s(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
