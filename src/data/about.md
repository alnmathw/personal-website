# Intro

Hi! I am an undergraduate student studying computer science in Singapore and I enjoy developing fullstack applications. My favorite languages to code in are OCaml, C++ and Python. Lately, I have also been getting into developing applications in VueJS and Kotlin. 

I am also very interested in finance and the financial markets. I used to work at Kredens Capital Management and Singular Asset Management where I recommended trading ideas to my portfolio manager and the Chief Investment Officer. I also had the chance to interact with our brokers and speak with clients. I learned a lot from my employers there.  

For extracurriculars, I am very invested leading the equity research division in Dragonfly, a Hong Kong based student finance club. There, I teach members basic accounting and stock analysis. Our members come from everywhere, including HKU, CUHK, LSE, U Penn and Cornell. If you would like to join our group, please feel free to send me an email! 

In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching comedy and playing Dota2. Two books that I believe everybody should read are [A Cofession by Leon Tolstoy][AConfession] and [Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl][ViktorFrankl]. Some of my favorite shows are Family Guy and One Piece. I also have about 7000+ hours of gameplay playing Dota2.
