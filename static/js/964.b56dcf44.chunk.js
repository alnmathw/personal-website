I enjoy developing frontend and backend software and I am always trying my best to learn new things to improve my skills. Before being interested in software engineering, I was very interested in finance and interned at Kredens Capital and Singular Asset Management doing equity research. \n\nAside from school, I spend my time leading equity research groups at Dragonfly HK. I enjoy sharing knowledge with others, especially about software development and equity research. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt university, I mostly take math and computer science classes.
