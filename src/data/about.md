# Intro

I am an undergraduate student studying computer science in Singapore. I enjoy developing frontend and backend software and I am always trying my best to learn new things to improve my skills. Before being interested in software engineering, I was very interested in finance and interned at Kredens Capital and Singular Asset Management doing equity research. 

Aside from school, I spend my time leading equity research groups at Dragonfly HK. I enjoy sharing knowledge with others, especially about software development and equity research. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At university, I mostly take math and computer science classes. However, I have also taught myself accounting and economics. 

# Some history

- At 15, I almost became a professional Dota2 player. 

- At 16, I attended a summer camp in Chiba, Japan, for two weeks by the Gakko Project. It was a transformative experience for me. 

- At 17, I travelled abroad and lived independently in Hong Kong to finish my highschool education at Li Po Chun UWC. 

- At 18, I travelled and volunteered at Yern Jas, Cambodia. My friends and I raised around US$16,455 to build schools and replenish school supplies in rural Cambodia. 

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
